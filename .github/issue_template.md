# You MUST NOT Use This Issue Template

## Introduction

We have decided to use multiple issue template instead of a single issue template. So you MUST create an issue with other issue templates which are described below.

## Templates

- [Create a bug report](?template=bug_report.md)
- [Create a feature request](?template=feature_request.md)
- [Create a decorator request](?template=decorator_request.md)
- [Create a block constructor request](?template=block_constructor_request.md)

## FAQ

### Why don't we use the single issue template

We think making the commonest issue template is too hard. So we don't use a single issue template. And [checkboxes](https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates/blob/master/conversational/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) are so verbose ;P

### Why don't we use [XXX]

Request now! We always are trying to accept your opinions. If the requests are reasonable enough, We will accept your opinions. We will try to apply your request to our projects as fast as we can.
